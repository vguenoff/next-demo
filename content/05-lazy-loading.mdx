## Lazy Loading in Next

```jsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const Latex = dynamic(() => import('react-latex-next'))
```

- Under the hood, this dynamic function uses [React.lazy](https://react.dev/reference/react/lazy). It's a drop-in replacement for it, and works exactly the same way. But by switching to dynamic, we get a couple small bells and whistles.

### Built-in loading state

- With **React.lazy**, we specify loading states by wrapping the lazy component in `<React.Suspense>`:

```jsx
const Latex = React.lazy(() => import('react-latex-next'))

;<React.Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>
  {showMath && <Latex>{'$2^4 - 4$'}</Latex>}
</React.Suspense>
```

- With **dynamic**, we can pass a second argument for configuration. One of the config options is a loading component:

```jsx
const Latex = dynamic(() => import('react-latex-next'), { loading: Spinner })

;<Latex>{'$2^4 - 4$'}</Latex>
```

- The dynamic function wraps up the **`<React.Suspense>`** element for us, so we can “bake in” a loading state for this particular component. We don't have to set up our own Suspense boundary.

- This isn't necessarily better. With React.lazy, we have more control, since we're the ones that place the Suspense boundary. This allows us to “batch” **multiple lazy-loaded components under one loading state**:

```jsx
const Latex = React.lazy(() => import('react-latex-next'))
const Fireworks = React.lazy(() => import('some-fireworks-package'))

function App() {
  const [showLatex, setShowLatex] = React.useState(false)

  return (
    <>
      <React.Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>
        <Latex />
        <Fireworks />
      </React.Suspense>
      <button onClick={() => setShowLatex(!showLatex)}>Toggle</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

- In this example, we have two heavy third-party components: `<Latex>` and `<Fireworks>` (which, presumably, would render some flashy fireworks on the screen). With **React.lazy**, we can group both of these components under one Suspense boundary, **showing a fallback UI until both have finished loading**.

### Disabling SSR

- Next gives us the option to disable server-side rendering for lazy-loaded components:

```jsx
const Fireworks = dynamic(() => import('../components/fireworks'), {
  ssr: false,
  loading: Spinner,
})
```

- When we do this, Next will render the fallback component during the server-side render. The initial HTML will contain a spinner, and it'll be **swapped out on the client once the js bundle is loaded**. This dynamic function gives us a tool we can use to skip rendering a component on the server, and only on the client.

- Ultimately, both **React.lazy** and **dynamic** are good tools to use for lazy loading in Next.js. Because they both use the same underlying technique, they have **the exact same performance characteristics**.
