title: 'Suspense & Streaming'
---

- The React team has long said that **Suspense is a low-level feature, something built into libraries and meta-frameworks**.

- And in fact, that's sorta how it's worked out. **The new version of Next uses Suspense under-the-hood**, to glorious effect. You don't need to understand Suspense at all to take advantage of it in Next!

## Using Suspense in Next

- The primary way to access Suspense in Next is through **loading.js**.

When we create a file named **loading.js** and colocate it next to page.js, Next will automatically wrap the two in a **Suspense boundary**. Somewhere in the Next.js codebase, there's likely some code that looks like this:

```jsx
function NextApp({ params, LoadingComponent, PageComponent }) {
  if (LoadingComponent) {
    return (
      <React.Suspense fallback={<LoadingComponent params={params} />}>
        <PageComponent params={params} />
      </React.Suspense>
    )
  }

  return <PageComponent params={params} />
}
```

By creating a loading.js component, we opt in to Suspense.

## There were two parts of the Suspense API:

- **Creating a Suspense boundary with `<React.Suspense>`** and broadcasting the loading status for components within the boundary.

- Also we know that Server Components can also be asynchronous. So when we render the component that performs an asynchronous action (e.g. fetch data), we get back a Promise, and that promise will resolve after the data-fetching is complete and the component has been rendered. And **with Server Components, React can use the component itself to track whether the component is ready or not**.

## Streaming

- Streaming allows you to break down the page's HTML into smaller chunks and progressively send those chunks from the server to the client.

```jsx
import { Suspense } from 'react'
import { PostFeed, Weather } from './Components'

export default function Posts() {
  return (
    <section>
      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading feed...</p>}>
        <PostFeed />
      </Suspense>
      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading weather...</p>}>
        <Weather />
      </Suspense>
    </section>
  )
}
```
