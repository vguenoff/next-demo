## Next's Metadata API

We can export a static metadata object:

```jsx
export const metadata = {
  title: 'Page title here!',
}
```

We can also use the generateMetadata function to dynamically calculate the page title from the route segments:

```jsx
export async function generateMetadata({ params }) {
  const profile = await getProfileInfo(params.profileId)

  return {
    title: `${profile.name}’s profile`,
  }
}
```

When the user visits /profiles/3, params.profileId will be equal to "3", and we use that parameter to fetch the user's profile info, so we can include the user's name in the document title.

## React Cache

The example above works well, but the trouble is that it often results in duplicate work being done. The component itself also needs to get the profile info!

```jsx
export async function generateMetadata({ params }) {
  const profile = await getProfileInfo(params.profileId)

  return {
    title: `${profile.name}’s profile`,
  }
}

async function ProfilePage({ params, searchParams }) {
  const profile = await getProfileInfo(params.profileId)

  // ✂️ Content removed for brevity
}
```

Fortunately, there is a solution to this problem: **React.cache**.
Here's what this looks like:

```jsx
import React from 'react'

export const getProfileInfo = React.cache(async profileId => {
  await delay(Math.random() * 200 + 400)
  return DATA[profileId]
})
```

React.cache allows us to memoize a function, so that the work won't be repeated when the function is called multiple times with the same parameters.

The best explanation I've heard for this is that it's **like React.memo, but for regular functions** instead of components.

**Note:**
This React.cache function is a work-in-progress. The React team is working on making it an official part of React. In the meantime, the Next team has patched React to include it. It's an official, ready-to-use part of Next.
