title: 'App Router'
---

## Overview

- The **/app** directory is the way of creating routes

- **page.tsx** lets us add the main content on the page

- **layout.tsx** provides a shared structure, to be used by one or more pages. Essentially, every visible page is a **combination of a layout and a page component**.

- We can nest directories if we want to create additional URLs. For example, if we create **/src/app/about/page.js**, that component will be shown when visiting **www.example.com/about**. The layout.tsx will be reused by default.

- All components in Next.js are **server components by default**. So, for example, if we try to add a useEffect() call, we'll get an error. We can convert any component to a Client Component with the **"use client"** directive.

## App Router

Apart from routing, App Router adds a range of other features, including:

### Layout Component → **layout.tsx**

- A layout component is a UI element that shapes a page's structure. It can include components like headers, footers, and sidebars, and even offer shared functions like navigation.

- Layout components work with routing, enabling smooth transitions between app pages. Since the layout component remains active when routes change, its state is retained, ensuring **consistent and reusable layouts with minimal effort**.

This component is designed to receive a children prop and **wrap all page files in the same directory** with it:

```jsx
export default function layout({ children }) {
  return <div className="layout">{children}</div>
}
```

### Nested Layouts

- Nested Layouts allows you to define multiple levels of layout components, each **enclosing the content of its child components**.
  This feature provides a flexible and modular way to structure your application's UI.

### Template Components → **template.tsx**

Template components are like layouts, but they create a **new instance for each child on navigation**. This means recreating DOM elements, losing state, and resetting effects every time the route changes.

You can use them for things like tracking page views or interactive widgets. You can create a template by exporting a default React component from a template.js file. This component should be designed to receive a children prop.

```jsx
export default function Template({ children }) {
  return <div>{children}</div>
}
```

### Error Component → error.tsx

- Making an error file auto-encloses the page with a React error boundary. Any error within this file's folder swaps the component with its contents.

The error component is rendered like this behind the scenes:

```jsx
<Layout>
  <ErrorBoundary fallback={<Error />}>
    <Page />
  </ErrorBoundary>
</Layout>
```

And shows something like this:

### Route Groups

- Route Groups **organize routes in the app directory without altering URL paths**. Enclosing a folder name in parentheses creates a Route Group that keeps related routes together.

- This allows for logical grouping, nested layouts, and a clean URL structure. That is:

In the example above, authentication pages are **grouped together for better organization, without altering URL structure**.
