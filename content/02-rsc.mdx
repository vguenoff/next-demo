## React Server Components

Here's example code for what RSC code looks like:

```jsx
export default async function TrendingProducts() {
  const link = mysqliConnect('localhost', 'root', 'passw0rd')
  const data = await mysqliQuery(link, 'SELECT * FROM products')

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Trending Products</h1>
      {data.map(item => (
        <article key={item.id}>
          <h2>{item.title}</h2>
          <p>{item.description}</p>
        </article>
      ))}
    </>
  )
}
```

So TrendingProducts is a React component, but it's also an async function and queries the database directly?? What's going on here?

- The big idea with “Server Components” is that they only **run on the server**.

- More technically, Server Components are **never hydrated on the client**. They're intended to be used for components that **don't need to be interactive**.

- We can think of “React Server Components” as an optional new “mode” for React. Within this optional “mode”, there are two types of components: **Server Components** and **Client Components**.

- **Server components** only render on the server. As a result, they stateless (they wouldn't be able to re-render if the state changed!). They also can't consume context, or use effects. They're a small subset of a typical React component.

- **Client Components** are the components we've been working already in pevious versions of Next.

- Confusingly, **Client Components still render on the server** during Server Side Rendering. They're called “Client Components” because they **do render on the client**, unlike “Server Components”:

- RSC and SSR are separate features. It's possible to use them separately. But they're intended to be used together:

- In the React Server Components paradigm, we need to declare whether a component is a Server Component or a client component. We can do this with directives:

```jsx
'use client'
import React from 'react'

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)

  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Count: {count}</button>
}
```

- In theory, we would also need to specify Server Components with another directive 'use server' but so far, the only framework to fully adopt React Server Components is Next. **In Next, all components are assumed to be Server Components by default**, and so we can omit it.

## The benefits of React Server Components

RSCs are a significant paradigm shift, an entirely new way to think about components.

- In RSCs default 'server component' we can fetch data on the server or query the database directly and than pass the it down the componetnt tree.

- Maybe most obvious benefit is **performance**. If half of the components in your application are Server Components, it means that your JS bundle will be significantly smaller, since all of that code can be omitted.

## Client components having server rendered children?

The chart above makes it seem that client component can have children that are server components but that's not the case.

- There's a super-important subtlety here: It's **not the parent/child relationship that matters, it's the owner/ownee relationship.**

```jsx
import ClientComponent from './ClientComponent'
import ServerComponent from './ServerComponent'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <ClientComponent>
      <ServerComponent />
    </ClientComponent>
  )
}
```

- On top-level there is a Server Component, and it **"owns" both the ClientComponent and ServerComponent components**. This is the relationship that matters!
