        We want to explore new Next.js features because moving to the App Router
        may be the first time using React features that Next.js builds on top of
        such as Server Components, Suspense, and more. When combined with new
        Next.js features such as special files and layouts, migration means new
        concepts, mental models, and behavioral changes to learn.
